    <h1>Pangolin</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Pangolins, sometimes known as scaly anteaters, are mammals of the order Pholidota (from Ancient Greek φολῐ́ς, "horny<br> scale"). The one extant family, Manidae, has three genera: Manis, Phataginus and Smutsia. Manis comprises the four species<br> found in Asia, while Phataginus and Smutsia include two species each, all found in Sub-Saharan Africa. These species range<br> in size from 30 to 100 cm (12 to 39 in). A number of extinct pangolin species are also known.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Pangolins have large, protective keratin scales covering their skin; they are the only known mammals with this feature. They<br> live in hollow trees or burrows, depending on the species. Pangolins are nocturnal, and their diet consists of mainly ants and<br> termites, which they capture using their long tongues. They tend to be solitary animals, meeting only to mate and produce a<br> litter of one to three offspring, which they raise for about two years.</p>

<h2>Poaching</h2>

<p>Pangolins are threatened by poaching (for their meat and scales, which are used in Chinese traditional medicine) and heavy<br> deforestation of their natural habitats, and are the most trafficked mammals in the world.As of January 2020, of the eight<br> species of pangolin, three (Manis culionensis, M. pentadactyla and M. javanica) are listed as critically endangered, three<br> (Phataginus tricuspis, Manis crassicaudata and Smutsia gigantea) are listed as endangered and two (Phataginus tetradactyla<br> and Smutsia temminckii) are listed as vulnerable on the Red List of Threatened Species of the International Union for<br> Conservation of Nature.</p>
